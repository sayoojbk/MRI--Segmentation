This CNN model could give a test accuracy around 71% .
This model used has 2 convolution layer with  a fully connected layer to help predict the output

The CNN architecture is build on Pytorch while the dataset was first preprocessed using openCV to 
to increase the edge detection accuracy which actually helps in increasing the accuracy of the model


The modules used are :
  1) OpenCV       - For image preprocessing
  2) Pytorch      - For building the CNN architecture

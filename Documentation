This CNN model could give a test accuracy around 71% .
This model used has 2 convolution layer with  a fully connected layer to help predict the output


The modules used are :
  1) OpenCV       - For image preprocessing
  2) Pytorch      - For building the CNN architecture



The image dataset was passed through sharpening filter which increases the possibility of edge detection
and then passed on to a simple Convolutional Layer build on Pytorch and the model was saved to file 
model1.ckpt
